## Setup

Once you have cloned this repo to your machine you should do the following:

1. run `npm install` this will install all the deps (specified in the `package.json` to your machine [aka jest for now])
2. you can then run the test suite locally using this command `npm run test`
3. you can view the actual site itself by opening the file called `index.html`
